This contains some code that I use for finite fault inversions (ffi). These mainly take the form of python wrappers for the following to sets of fortran codes:

1) dcs_python.f: The Okada code for calculated ealstic deformation due to dislocations in an elastic half-space

2) kiklib.f: The Kikuchi code for body wave synthetic seismograms

3) surf.f: Code for caulculating seismic surface wave synthetics. This has nto yet been wrapped in pythin.

The python routines in ffi.py that are probably of most interest are:

fault_grid(): Calculates a grid of subfault for a given fault geometry

fault_disp(): Calculates surface displacement for dislocation on a grid of subfaults as given by fault_grid(). Note that coordinate transformation, etc, is done in the corresponding fortran subroutine fault_disp() in dcs_python.f

Finally, there is a python script ffiplot.py that is used for plotting finite fault solutions. I'm afraid this is uncommented at the moment but I'll try to change that soon
